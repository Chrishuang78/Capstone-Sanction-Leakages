# Capstone-Sanction-Leakages
Analyzing post-2021 trade, this study maps how sanctions on Russia leak through third-party countries. Using UN Comtrade data and EXIOBASE MRIO, we track 20 critical HS-6 products, quantify supply rerouting and Russiaâ€™s output losses, and identify top intermediaries and sectors driving substitution despite coalition export bans.
